# My thinking behind this Blog Site.

I don't write anymore. Not in the traditional sense.

I don't sit with a blank page, wrestling sentences into shape. I don't write code either—not a single line. What I do, all day, is type into a small chat box. Sometimes I just talk to it.

And yet, here's a blog. Full of writing. Full of technical ideas. How does that work?

**These posts are AI-assisted, but they're not AI-generated content.** That distinction matters.

I don't ask an AI to brainstorm blog topics and then generate posts about them. That's slop—low-effort, hollow, SEO-bait churned out at scale. I understand why people are skeptical of AI content. A lot of it deserves that skepticism.

What happens here is different. I spend hours working on personal projects—building agents, experimenting with frameworks, debugging weird edge cases. I do this work *with* an AI, talking through problems, trying solutions, hitting walls, finding workarounds. That's the real work.

The blog posts are artifacts of those sessions.

When I figure out something useful—how to track token usage per module in DSPy, how to manage tools in an agent, how to stream responses in a specific way—I ask the AI to help me turn that session into a post. The knowledge is real. The problems were real. The solutions emerged from actual work.

The word *elicited* captures this. To elicit is to draw out, to bring forth what wouldn't otherwise surface. These posts couldn't exist without the technical work that produced them. They're not manufactured content; they're documentation of genuine exploration.

If you're reading this, you're probably curious about what that looks like. The posts here reflect what I'm actually building and learning. Nothing more, nothing less.
