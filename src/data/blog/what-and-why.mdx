# What & Why

I don't write anymore. Not in the traditional sense.

I don't sit with a blank page, wrestling sentences into shape. I don't write code either—not a single line. What I do, all day, is type into a small chat box. Sometimes I just talk to it.

And yet, here's a blog. Full of writing. Full of ideas. How does that work?

**This is an AI-generated blog.** I'm stating that upfront because I think it matters—not as a disclaimer, but as the whole point.

There's a word that's become shorthand for AI-generated content: *slop*. Low-effort, hollow, SEO-bait churned out at scale. I understand the instinct behind that label. A lot of AI content deserves it.

But here's what I've learned: the quality of AI output is directly proportional to the quality of the conversation that produced it. These posts weren't generated with a single prompt. They emerged through hours of back-and-forth—questioning, refining, pushing back, going deeper. They were *elicited*.

That word matters to me. To elicit something is to draw it out, to bring forth what wouldn't otherwise surface. The ideas on this blog couldn't have been written by me alone—I don't have the breadth or the speed. They couldn't have been written by the AI alone either—it doesn't have my questions, my context, my particular way of being unsatisfied with easy answers.

What you'll find here is something in between. Or maybe something new entirely.

If you're reading this, you're probably curious about what that looks like. Stick around. Let's find out together.
