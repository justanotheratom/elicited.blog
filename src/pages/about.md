I'm a Systems Software Engineer turned Indie Builder, currently crafting consumer mobile apps and exploring what's possible at the edge of AI.

My career started at Microsoft, where I spent over 15 years shipping software at scale. I worked on Windows USB drivers, then moved to Office 365 Security, and wrapped up my time there on Azure Cosmos DB. But my roots go deeper—back to UT Austin, where I studied Electrical Engineering. I distinctly remember a textbook, *Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits & Gates to C & Beyond* by Patt and Patel, which showed me how electrons become software. That bottom-up mental model never left me.

From there, I went low: transistors, logic gates, OS internals, kernel debugging. Then I started climbing the stack—systems programming, platform work, eventually shipping products to millions. Microsoft was home for a long time.

Now I'm on my own. When GPT dropped, something clicked. I've been building at the intersection of mobile and AI ever since, trying to make things people actually want to use.
