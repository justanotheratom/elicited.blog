# About Me

Hi, I'm Your Name! 👋

I'm a curious builder who loves turning ideas into working software. I spend my days exploring modern web tooling, learning in public, and documenting the messy middle between spark and shipping.

This blog is my home base for experiments, lessons learned, and the occasional deep dive into workflows that make creative work sustainable.

## What I Write About

- Practical web development tips
- Product thinking & learning notes
- Systems for focus and creativity
